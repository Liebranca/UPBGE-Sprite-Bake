# UPBGE Sprite Bake

Utility script for making sprites in Blender. TODO: Game logic for better UPBGE integration.

# To use:
  1. Open scripts in text editor.
  
  2. Adjust render settings and frame start/end in timeline. Render dimensions are used to determine the height and width of each tile within the sheet, and render -> output -> filepath is where the image is saved to.
  
  3. Open up sprite_bake_user.py and set up sheet name and sheet size values. This is simple; size.x times size.y must be equal to the ammout of frames of animation. If name is not unique, previous object/image is overwritten.
  
  4. Press "Run script" in text editor.

This is open sauce, you do what you want with it except saying it's yours.
